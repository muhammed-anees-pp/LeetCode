# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my **LeetCode problem-solving journey**.  
I am practicing problems in order and uploading solutions with clean, structured code.  
The goal is to **track progress, stay consistent, and build problem-solving skills**.

## 🧭 Track Your Progress with Notion

To make progress tracking easier and more interactive, I’ve created a **Notion page** designed to help you organize and review your LeetCode journey using **spaced repetition**.

👉 **Notion Link:** [LeetCode Progress Tracker](https://www.notion.so/Leetcode-29143b0812b280df9359e6fe4ea081b5?source=copy_link)

### 📋 How to Use the Notion Page
1. **Duplicate the Page:**  
   Click the “•••” menu at the top-right corner of the Notion page → choose **Duplicate** to copy it into your own workspace.

2. **Add Your Problems:**  
   List each LeetCode problem you solve (e.g., *“Two Sum (1)”*) in the first column.

3. **Add the Problem Link:**  
   Paste the LeetCode problem URL next to it for quick access.

4. **Track Dates:**  
   - Record the **Last Solved Date** whenever you complete a problem.  
   - Set a **Next Review Date** based on your performance (7–14 days recommended).

5. **Review Progressively:**  
   Each time you solve a problem **without help**, increase the “Successful Reviews” count.  
   If you need help, reset it to 0.  
   Over time, this builds a **strong review cycle** to retain problem-solving skills efficiently.
